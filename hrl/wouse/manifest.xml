    The wouse package is software for the "Wince-mouse": optical mouse components mounted to a pair of glasses such that the mouse reports the movement of the skin near the temples.  This device was developed under the Robots for Humanity project to act as a reliable, wearable run-stop for persons with severe physical disabilities.
